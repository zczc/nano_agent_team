# Systematic Debugging

> **Scenario:** Coding — Use this skill when diagnosing and fixing bugs in code.

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Production bugs
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

5. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples** — Locate similar working code in same codebase
2. **Compare Against References** — Read reference implementation COMPLETELY
3. **Identify Differences** — List every difference, however small
4. **Understand Dependencies** — What components, config, environment needed?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis** — State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
2. **Test Minimally** — Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
3. **One Variable at a Time** — Don't fix multiple things at once
4. **When You Don't Know** — Say "I don't understand X". Don't pretend.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Use `activate_skill("test-driven-development")` for writing proper failing tests
   - **MUST have before fixing**

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture**

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**
   - Each fix reveals new problems in different places
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring"
   - **This is NOT a failed hypothesis — this is a wrong architecture**
   - Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes

## Red Flags — STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "I probably know why, let me fix that"

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |
